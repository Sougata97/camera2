  <h1>Uploadcare Widget. Crop image to circle..</h1>
  <p>
    This Pen shows you how to use the Uploadcare Widget UI to crop any image to circle.
  Technically, it uses some CSS to round out an image cropped using the 1:1 ratio.
  </p>
  <!-- The input element below will turn into the widget -->
  <input type="hidden" role="uploadcare-uploader" data-crop="1:1" data-images-only >
  <!-- Your preview will be put here -->
  <div>
    <img src="" alt="" id="preview" width=300 height=300 />
